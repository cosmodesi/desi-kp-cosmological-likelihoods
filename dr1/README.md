# DR1 likelihoods

The notebook ```read_clustering_statistics.ipynb``` illustrates how to read the DR1 Full-Shape and BAO clustering statistics.
The script ```prepare_fiducial_likelihood.py``` illustrates how to prepare the final likelihoods (including scale cuts and systematic contributions) from the raw data, window matrix and covariance matrix.
The directory ```cobaya``` is a [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya) implementation of the Full-Shape + BAO likelihoods.
